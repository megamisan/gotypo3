The aim of GoTYPO3 is to automate and simplify the deployment of the TYPO3 CMS. Focused on Debian GNU/Linux and written in bash GoTYPO3 is modular and can be adapted to other distributions.

GoTYPO3 currently supports server configuration, virtual hosts configuration, FTP users configuration and TYPO3 installation.

GoTYPO3 is a set of scripts designed to be downloaded from a deployment server via HTTP or HTTPS with wget and then piped directly to a bash shell with the use of a simple command.
